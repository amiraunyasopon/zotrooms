## Inspiration
Each and every year, students, clubs, and proper organizations on campus book study rooms to host their finals cramming session, monthly dungeon and dragons meeting, and board meetings. However, the current platform in place remains difficult to accurately search for rooms based on the needs of the students.

That’s why we built ZotRooms, a user-friendly platform enabling anyone to search and filter through study room availabilities and capacities. We aim to make booking the right study rooms easier for all UCI students.

## What it does

ZotRooms uses React to create a user friendly platform to search for available study rooms. This is made possible with Anteater API which fetchs data on the study rooms all over campus. Users are then able to search through available study rooms with specifics such as dates, time slots, and max capacities.

This system is accessed via our frontend, built with React and Next.js.
