# ZotHacks 2025
## Inspiration
Every year, students, clubs, and campus organizations book study rooms for tutoring sessions, final exam cram sessions, and board meetings. However, the current resources make it difficult to search for rooms that meet students' specific needs.

ZotRooms solves this problem with a user-friendly platform that lets anyone search and filter study room availability. We aim to make finding and booking the right study room easier for all UCI students.

## What it does

ZotRooms helps students find and reserve study rooms across campus. Using the Anteater API to fetch real-time room data, students can easily filter available spaces by date, time, and location.
